# Word-of-the-day scraper using Python

## Purpose
This script navigates to www.merriam-webster.com and pulls only the pertinent info for today's current word, definitions, and fun fact - and displays them in the terminal.

## Tools 
- python
- requests module
- beautifulsoup module

### Further development
I'd like to automate running this script every morning.
